Similar to what the Turo App looks like, all designed with SwiftUI. I did it very simple, the idea is to implement map kit now, and also use Combine to handle real time data updates for car availability, pricing and booking status.

For the future also implement push notifications, an authentication service to sign in with Apple, so design a Login interface first

Add some Customs Views and Anmations like TUro

Add SwiftData for offline functionality
